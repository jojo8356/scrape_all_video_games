# Readme - Code Overview and Explanation

This Python script scrapes information about video games from various Wikipedia pages related to gaming consoles and platforms. It fetches game data such as the game title, platforms it's available on, and its genre. The scraped data is then stored in a specific format.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- beautifulsoup4 library
- requests library
- lxml parser

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
pip install lxml
```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script (filename.py).
2. The script will scrape information about video games from various Wikipedia pages and store the data in a specific format.
3. The data will be stored in the jeux list, containing information in the format: title#platforms#genre#link.

## How It Works

1. The script first fetches the Wikipedia page containing the list of video games for each selected gaming console/platform.
2. It then goes through the Wikipedia pages, extracting relevant URLs for individual games listed on those pages.
3. The script uses the URLs to visit each game's Wikipedia page and scrape relevant information like the game's title, supported platforms, and genre.
4. The scraped information is stored in a specific format and saved in the jeux list.
5. Finally, the script sorts the list and prints the execution time in seconds.

## Disclaimer

This script relies on web scraping Wikipedia pages, which might be subject to changes in the structure or content over time. As a result, the script's reliability might be affected if the Wikipedia pages' structure changes.

Please note that this README is meant to provide an overview and explanation of the script. For a complete working version, ensure that the required libraries are installed and the Python script is executed correctly. Modify and customize the script as needed to suit your specific use case.

Feel free to use this markdown as a template for your README. You can further tailor the content and format to meet your project's specific requirements.
